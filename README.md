## Instructions

To run the game, simply launch index.html in a web browser.

To play, use the arrow keys to move the character in the direction of the
corresponding key. The player begins at the center of the bottom row. The goal
is to reach the top of the map (where the water is) without getting hit by any
bugs. If a player is touched by a bug before he reaches the top, the game will
reset. Once the player reaches the top, he wins!

## Dependencies

None.
